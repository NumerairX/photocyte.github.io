## Biosynthesis of natural products
(Under construction)

Many natural products (biological small molecules of <2 kDa) are commercially valuable (e.g. medicines, fragrances), or represent valuable tools for modulating ecological interactions between species for commercial gain (e.g. pheremones). The diversity of natural products spans the 

## Eukaryotic specialized metabolism
(Under construction)

Scientific study of fungal and bacterial natural product biosynthesis has been greatly assisted by the clustering of assosciated enzymes in the genome. In contrast, non-fungal metazoans, which also have a rich and diversity of small molecule natural products, are not known to cluster their genes by functional, making discovery of novel chemistry greatly more difficult. 

I am interested in applying next generation 'omic' tools, such as *de novo* genomics and transcriptomics, stable-isotope-assisted LC-MS and NMR based metabolomics, bottom-up proteomics, alongside classical forward genetics and modern CRISPR/Cas9 based forward genetics, to establish. 


## Evolution of complex traits
(Under construction)

The evolution of a complex traits is a fundamental question in biology.
